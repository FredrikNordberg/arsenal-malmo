# Arsenal Malmö – Custom Supporter Website

Welcome to my custom-built version of the **Arsenal Malmö** supporter club website!  
This is a modern, fast, and fully responsive web app built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Tailwind CSS** – inspired by their current site, but completely reimagined to match my own design preferences and vision for a better digital experience.

## 🚀 What is this?

This project is a **personal redesign** of [Arsenal Malmö's](https://arsenalmalmo.se) official supporter club site. While it contains the same core content and spirit, I’ve taken full creative freedom to:

- Improve layout and responsiveness
- Add interactive elements like sliders and transitions
- Create a custom, cleaner navigation system
- Make the design more modern and Arsenal-inspired

This is **not** an official rebuild, but a **fan-driven initiative** for learning, inspiration, and showcasing what's possible with modern web tools.
